# Project Information
The Harambe Token represents an innovative integration of artificial intelligence (AI) trading with the power of Meme tokens. Named in homage to the internet meme of Harambe, the project transcends its meme origins, focusing on the utilization of AI technology to drive its functionality and value.

At the heart of the Harambe Token project is an advanced AI neural network auto-trading bot. This bot is designed to autonomously conduct trades in the cryptocurrency market. It is trained on historical data, including strategies and trades from elite hedge funds and seasoned trader.

The A.I. bot is deployed on the blockchain and operates around the clock to analyzes the market, and executing trades based on its ever-evolving understanding of market dynamics. This AI-driven approach aims to outperform traditional, emotion-driven trading strategies.

Harambe Token employs a unique growth strategy. Profits generated by the AI trading bot are used to implement a buy-back and burn mechanism. This process involves the automatic repurchase and removal of Harambe Tokens from the market, thereby reducing supply and potentially increasing the token's value over time. The concept is designed to create a self-sustaining model that enhances the token's value for its holders.

The project aims to democratize the experience of a hedge fund, traditionally reserved for a select group of investors. By acquiring Harambe Tokens, investors gain exposure to the AI trading bot's performance. The project encourages community involvement, allowing token holders to benefit from the AI's trading success without requiring active participation in trading activities.
